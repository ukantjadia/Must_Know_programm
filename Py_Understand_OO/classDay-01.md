- method -> a function that is associated with a class
- Class -> a class we can use to create a blueprint of each employee, So we don't have to create it from scratch for employee
- instance variable -> contain data that is create to each instance
- `__init__` -> this is class way of creating the instance variable for 
            <br> think of  `__init__` as a initializer and if you are with other language background take it as a constructor
- method -> adding a functionallity
- Each method in a class automatically takes instance as a first argument and always called that self
