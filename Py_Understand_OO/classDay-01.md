- method -> a function that is associated with a class
- Class -> a class we can use to create a blueprint of each employee, So we don't have to create it from scratch for employee
- instance variable -> contains data that is created for each instance
- `__init__` -> this is a class way of creating the instance variable for 
            <br> think of  `__init_`_` as an initializer and if you are with another language background take it as a constructor
- method -> adding a functionality
- Each method in a class automatically takes an instance as a first argument and always called that self
- calling a method -> calling the method in different ways `className.`methodName(instanceName)` and `instanceName.methodName()`


### Difference between a class and an instance of a class
class - class is a blueprint for creating instances for each employee
instance - creating a user of any class like employee
